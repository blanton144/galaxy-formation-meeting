	<p class="text-start">The primary goal of the workshop is:</p>

        <p class='text-center'><i>"To identify new research questions in galaxy formation
        enabled by recent developments in galaxy formation theory and
        in spectroscopic observations of the Milky Way and other 
        galaxies in the low redshift universe"</i> </p>


        <p class="text-start">This workshop will be primarily focused on discussion and 
        on the development of new research questions enabled by recent 
        progress in theory and observation. The exact agenda will be 
        developed in collaboration with the participants in the run-up 
        to the meeting. We expect a small number of plenary talks, 
        with most of the time devoted to parallel discussion 
        sessions oriented towards individual topics.</p>

        <p class="text-start">We will bring together observers conducting extragalactic and
        Galactic spectroscopic wide field surveys with theorists 
        predicting the formation and evolution of galaxies. It has 
        a special (but not exclusive!) focus on the Sloan Digital 
        Sky Survey and its wide field spectroscopic programs (e.g. 
        the Legacy Survey, SEGUE, MaNGA, APOGEE, Milky Way Mapper, 
        etc). We expect to concentrate on topics like: Are we using 
        the full suite of modern observations to test and constrain 
        theory? What can the Milky Way teach us about disk galaxies 
        in general? And what can it not? Can we really understand 
        distant galaxies without resolved stellar population measurements? 
        Why do simulations not reproduce the structure and dynamics 
        of galaxies? Do active galactic nuclei affect the star formation 
        histories of galaxies? Can Milky Way and galaxy observations 
        constrain alternative dark matter models? Are galaxy bars and 
        bulges causes or effects of inside-out galaxy formation? 
        Does stellar orbital evolution play a significant role in 
        galaxies evolution? </p>

        <p class="text-start">This workshop can accommodate up to about 150 attendees,
        who will be selected from among applicants to ensure a 
        breadth of attendees in terms of interests, background, 
        career stage, and demographics.  </p>
