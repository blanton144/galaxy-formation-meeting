	<p class="text-start">The primary goal of the workshop is:</p>

        <p class='text-center'><i>"To identify new research questions in galaxy formation
        enabled by recent developments in theory and
        in spectroscopic observations of the Milky Way and other 
        low redshift galaxies."</i> </p>


        <p class="text-start">
This workshop will develop new research questions enabled by 
recent progress in theory and observation. A small number of 
plenary talks will provide a framework, while most of the workshop 
will be devoted to parallel discussion sessions oriented towards 
individual topics. The exact agenda will be developed collaboratively
with participants in the run-up to the meeting. </p>

        <p class="text-start">We will bring together observers conducting extragalactic and
        Galactic spectroscopic wide field surveys with theorists 
        predicting the formation and evolution of galaxies. It has 
        a special (but not exclusive!) focus on the Sloan Digital 
        Sky Survey and its wide field spectroscopic programs (e.g. 
        the Legacy Survey, SEGUE, MaNGA, APOGEE, Milky Way Mapper, 
        Local Volume Mapper, etc). Topics of interest may include:
        How can we better realize 
        the full potential of modern observations to test and constrain 
        theory? What can the Milky Way teach us about disk galaxies 
        in general? And what can it not? How well can we really understand 
        distant galaxies without resolved stellar population measurements? 
        Why do simulations not reproduce the structure and dynamics 
        of galaxies? Do active galactic nuclei affect the star formation 
        histories of galaxies? Can Milky Way and galaxy observations 
        constrain alternative dark matter models? Are galaxy bars and 
        bulges the causes or the effects of inside-out galaxy formation? 
        Does stellar orbital evolution play a significant role in 
        galaxies' evolution? </p>

        <p class="text-start">This workshop can accommodate up to about 150 attendees.
        Participants will be selected from among applicants with attention
        given to ensure a breadth of expertise and interests, as well as 
        full representation of all career stages and demographics.  </p>
