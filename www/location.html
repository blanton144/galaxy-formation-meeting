<p class="text-start">The meeting will be held at <a href="https://biosphere2.org">Biosphere 2</a>, about 45 minutes north of Tucson, Arizona.</p>

<p class="text-start">Biosphere 2 has on site housing, which can accommodate
about half of our anticipated attendance, and for the other half we will
arrange a nearby hotel block, with shuttles available for transportation
to Biosphere 2.</p>

<p class="text-start">Breakfast, lunch, and dinner will be available on
site. There are basically no other practical (i.e. even remotely nearby)
options for meals. We will
have snacks and drinks available for off hours, and there are fridges
and microwaves in the on-site housing. </p>

<p class="text-start">
The area is a desert, so is very dry and sunny, and you should be 
prepared with sunglasses, hats, sunscreen, and water. The typical
highs in late March are mid-60s, and lows in the 40s (Fahrenheit),
a bit cooler than Tucson.</p>

<p class="text-start">Do take care on and around site regarding Arizona
wildlife, since there are known to be rattlesnakes, scorpions, and
coyotes in the area.</p>

is annotated with the locations of workshop activities.</p>
