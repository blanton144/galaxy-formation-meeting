	<p class="text-start">Meeting Code of Conduct</p>

<p>We are requesting that all participants abide by the same
<a href="https://www.aps.org/meetings/policies/code-conduct.cfm">Code of Conduct</a> 
that the American Physical Society adopts for its meetings. 
This code is copied below, with slight wording adjustments
to account for the fact that this is not an APS meeting.</p>

<p>
"It is [our] policy of that all participants, including attendees, vendors, staff, volunteers, and all other stakeholders at [this meeting] will conduct themselves in a professional manner that is welcoming to all participants and free from any form of discrimination, harassment, or retaliation. Participants will treat each other with respect and consideration to create a collegial, inclusive, and professional environment at [this meeting]. Creating a supportive environment to enable scientific discourse at APS meetings is the responsibility of all participants.</p>

<p>Participants will avoid any inappropriate actions or statements based on individual characteristics such as age, race, ethnicity, sexual orientation, gender identity, gender expression, marital status, nationality, political affiliation, ability status, educational background, or any other characteristic protected by law. Disruptive or harassing behavior of any kind will not be tolerated. Harassment includes but is not limited to inappropriate or intimidating behavior and language, unwelcome jokes or comments, unwanted touching or attention, offensive images, photography without permission, and stalking.</p>

<p>Violations of this code of conduct policy should be reported to meeting organizers[]. Sanctions may range from verbal warning, to ejection from the meeting without refund, to notifying appropriate authorities. Retaliation for complaints of inappropriate conduct will not be tolerated. If a participant observes inappropriate comments or actions and personal intervention seems appropriate and safe, they should be considerate of all parties before intervening."</p>
