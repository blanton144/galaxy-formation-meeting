<p class="text-start">Biosphere 2 is about an hour north of Tucson, Arizona.</p>

<p class="text-start"><b>What to bring:</b> An open mind, your 
expertise and curiosity, but also: sunscreen, sunglasses, water bottle,
hat for sun protection, and some clothing appropriate for the chilly 
nights.</p>

<p class="text-start"><b>Hotels:</b> Biosphere 2 has on site housing available
for check-in on Monday March 27 and check-out Friday March 31. 
Biosphere 2 can accommodate most of our anticipated attendance, and for 
the rest we arranged a nearby hotel block. Shuttles 
will provide transportation to Biosphere 2 each morning and evening
from the Fairfield Inn. If you need information about the hotel or
Biosphere 2 please contact the organizers.</p>

<p class="text-start"><b>Rental Cars:</b> If you want to rent a car for 
your trip, this is high season for Tucson, so you should do so as soon
as you can. Also, you will have to ask the organizers for instructions
for entering through the Biosphere 2 gates.</p>

<p class="text-start"><b>Arrival:</b> You should plan 
to arrive on Monday, March 27, 2023. Check-in to the rooms at 
Biosphere 2 is at 3pm. For those staying at Biosphere 2,
there will be a light dinner (e.g. sandwiches) available on Monday
evening. <b>However, there is not really any food option at
Biosphere 2 before that so we recommend you have or bring
lunch if you are arriving earlier than check-in.</b></p>

<p class="text-start"><b>Departure:</b> The meeting ends on Friday,
March 31, 2023. To stay the whole meeting, you will need to schedule
your departure Friday night or on Saturday. Unfortunately because of 
Biosphere 2's constraints, those staying there will have to check out
on Friday (so if you have to leave Saturday, you need to book Friday
night either in one of the hotel blocks or 
at a hotel nearer the airport).</p>

<p class="text-start"><b>Airport:</b> For those flying from out of 
town, the nearest
airport is <a href="https://www.flytucson.com/">Tucson International 
Airport (TUS).</a> It is not always possible to get a ride service 
like Uber to pick up at Biosphere 2 to get to the airport!
We are providing shuttles from and
back to the airport on Monday and Friday. <b>If you need to use the
shuttle service, but have not heard from us about or filled out 
the travel form, contact the organizers!</b>
