<p class="text-start">Biosphere 2 is about an hour north of Tucson, Arizona.</p>

<p class="text-start"><b>Hotels:</b> Biosphere 2 has on site housing available
for check-in on Monday March 27 and check-out Friday March 31. 
Biosphere 2 can accommodate about half of our anticipated attendance, and for 
the other half we will arrange a nearby hotel block. Shuttles 
will provide transportation to Biosphere 2 each morning and evening. 
Biosphere 2 and hotel reservation details will be available at the
time of registration.</p>

<p class="text-start"><b>Arrival:</b> You should plan 
to arrive on Monday, March 27, 2023. For those staying at Biosphere 2,
there will be a light dinner (e.g. sandwiches) available on Monday
evening.</p>

<p class="text-start"><b>Departure:</b> The meeting ends on Friday,
March 31, 2023. To stay the whole meeting, you will need to schedule
your departure Friday night or on Saturday. Unfortunately because of 
Biosphere 2's constraints, those staying there will have to check out
on Friday (so if you have to leave Saturday, you need to book Friday
night at a hotel near the airport).</p>

<p class="text-start"><b>Airport:</b> For those flying from out of 
town, the nearest
airport is <a href="https://www.flytucson.com/">Tucson International 
Airport (TUS).</a> We are considering providing shuttles from and
back to the airport on Monday and Friday.</p>
