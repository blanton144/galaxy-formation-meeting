<p>The schedule below is subject to change. Details about locations 
and other details about the parallel sessions will be forthcoming!</p>

<p>We will begin with an introduction to the workshop and a town hall
designed to let members discuss what they hope to get out of the workshop
and to ensure that we have a productive and rewarding set of discussions
for all.</p>

<p>There will be three plenary talks, that will be designed to set the
scene for the discussions: what are our current and near future capabilities
in simulations of galaxy formation, in Galactic observations, and in 
extragalactic observations? Obviously these cannot be comprehensive 
but they will hopefully be a spur and guide to thought!</p>

<p>The bulk of the time will be in parallel discussions led by a set
of discussion leaders. We have also tried to keep a good amount of break
time and free time, to allow participants to have unstructured 
conversations.</p>
