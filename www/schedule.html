<p class="text-start">A block schedule is shown at the bottom of this page.</p>

<p class="text-start">We will begin with an introduction to the workshop and a town hall
designed to let members discuss what they hope to get out of the workshop
and to ensure that we have a productive and rewarding set of discussions
for all.</p>

<p class="text-start">There will be three plenary talks, that will be designed to set the
scene for the discussions: what are our current and near future capabilities
in simulations of galaxy formation, in Galactic observations, and in 
extragalactic observations? Obviously these cannot be comprehensive 
but they will hopefully be a spur and guide to thought!</p>

<p class="text-start">The bulk of the time will be in parallel discussions led by a set
of discussion leaders. We have also tried to keep a good amount of break
time and free time, to allow participants to have unstructured 
conversations.</p>

<p class="text-start">Detailed information about the discussion groups is being sent
by email to participants, but their basic nature is as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>Each one will be led by three discussion group leaders.</li>
<li>There will be two “flights” of discussion groups ("A" and "B"), with 
the 
Flight A covering Tuesday and Wednesday, and the Flight B covering 
Thursday and Friday.</li>
<li>There will be five discussion groups of about twenty people each
in each flight, each covering a different topic.</li>
<li>During Flight A of the parallel sessions, every participant 
will have the opportunity to give a five minute talk. </li>
</ul>

<p class="text-start">We have also scheduled "working time" during which the parallel
break out rooms are available, for less formal discussions and 
individual meetings between participants.</p>

<p>We are asking all participants to abide by the <a href="conduct.html">APS Code of Conduct</a>.</p>
